 Python Core Java Django Machine Learning HTML CSS  Smart Button Akash Singh   Django Mqtt NodeMCU      This is an IoT product that enables you to send logs remotely over the internet using MQTT. It has a single button that enables you to trigger  different types of logs and also helps to configure wifi on the device. I also created the API's and database using django that enables user to manage their devices using a web app or android app. Visual Search Kashyap Raval   Flask Keras HTML Deep Learning  This was a search feature that helped user to upload an image of a room scene and the system would localize  class of furniture in the image and give out relevant tags. For each tags the system also returns the most similar images of the relevant object detected. This used CNN architecture. Remote Image Capture and Object Detection Vijay Ukani   Python Raspberry Pi Mqtt OpenCV  This was a wifi based system in which a user can request an image capture query over MQTT and the Rpi captures the image of the scene which it sends to the server using FTP. At server a pre trained object detection model creates a new image with bounded boxes and sends this to the user. This was completely meant to understand wireless communication architecture that involved heavy computer vision models to be deployed on server.
